But what if you don't have access to a real Suitcase Piano? Or what if you want to add some modern twists to the retro sound? That's where Session Keys Electric S comes in. This is a virtual instrument by e-instruments that faithfully reproduces the sound and feel of the 1973 Suitcase Piano, using high-quality samples and advanced features.
 
Session Keys Electric S is powered by KONTAKT, which means you can use it with any DAW that supports VST, AU, or AAX plugins. You can also use it with the free KONTAKT PLAYER or the KOMPLETE KONTROL keyboards.
 
Session Keys Electric S offers two separate sound banks: Studio and Live. The Studio bank captures the pure and pristine sound of the Suitcase Piano in a controlled environment, while the Live bank adds some grit and character from the amp and speakers. You can switch between them with a single click, or blend them together for more variety.
 
One of the most innovative features of Session Keys Electric S is the Pentamorph, a knob that lets you transform the overall sound with five different modes: Electric, Reverse, Acoustic, Pad, and Hybrid. You can create anything from realistic piano sounds to atmospheric pads and synth-like textures.
 
Another cool feature is the Animator, which provides over 400 flexible phrases in different styles and genres. You can trigger them with your keyboard or pads, and adjust their tempo, complexity, and dynamics. The Animator is great for adding some groove and movement to your tracks.
 
If you want to spice up your chords, you can use the Smart Chord function, which generates instant piano chords from single keys or pads. You can choose from different chord types and voicings, and even create your own custom chords.
 
Session Keys Electric S also comes with a comprehensive effects chain, including Tremolo/AutoPan, Chorus, Phaser, Amp Simulator, Compressor, Delay, and Convolution Reverb. You can tweak each effect to your liking, or use the presets for quick results.
 
With Session Keys Electric S, you can recreate the legendary suitcase sound with ease and flexibility. Whether you want to go for a vintage vibe or a modern twist, this virtual instrument will give you endless possibilities for your music production.
